0,ASR,"Verdict : A Solid buy for this price segment in 2022 (and even for early 2023)There are 2 reviews in this section. Review 1 is 30 days after purchase (Typos in the Review 1 has rectified now) and Review 2 is 15 days post Android 13 beta update. These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on 1 August 2022.Before OOS 13 update, 5G (only for Jio) was enabled via another update. 5G is still not available in my region. Hence, 5G related parameters are not covered in this review.Review 2: After about 15 days of Oxygen OS 13 Beta update (Android 13):(Update received on 1 Dec 2023).Note: After the beta update, no new issues popped up.i.e., there were;No Heating related issues.No fast battery drain.No change in the Charging time.No annoying bugs.No change in camera performance.Beta update is mostly like a Stable update.OOS 13 (Android 13) update review:Delighters:> No new apps added. Absolutely NOT.> System storage consumption remains the same (13.2 GB).> Animations are more fluidic.> More customization UI features added. (Scout widgets in home screen, Enlarged folder & lot more.)> Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier.> Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor.> Ability to play videos in the background & screen OFF as well (even for YouTube)  (Really a welcoming & longing feature, which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF)> Stand-by battery life has improved substantially.Disappointers:> Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before.> No improvement in Sound levels. Still initial 40% is too silent.> No Dolby Atomos (which was mentioned for OOS 13). Perhaps, to wait for Stable update.> Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier. Response time is tad increased.> Haptics have become tighter than earlier, but still not stronger.=======================================================================Review 1:Verdict - A Good Buy in this price range in 2022.Note:- This review is after a month's usage.- Received 2 updates during the course of time (Recent update was of 0.98 GB).- System consumes 13.2 GB space. 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage.- N77 band is missing for 5G.- The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue.- Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile. No noticeable difference observed. ( In Non-gaming aspect)- Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parameters.Things that are delighting;> Exceptional signal reception (especially 4G+ carrier aggregation). Very fast download speeds.> Insane Fast charging (0 to 100% in 40 mins, 30 to 100 % in 20 mins, excluding trickle charge). No heating of the mobile (just slight warming) during charging.> Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic (Even more than 7.5 hrs, for Videos, YT and general tasks and calls, even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver.> Oxygen OS = Color OS/Realme OS - Bloatware. The skin is really good & nothing to complain like other brands' UI.> Absolutely no 3rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any 2nd party apps. Even some 2nd party apps are ""un-installable"". No major bothering bugs noticed till date.> Yes, the ""Alert slider"" is included, unlike some premium OnePlus models.Things that are annoying;> Dual ambient light sensor (1 in rear and other in front) is not well calibrated. The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required.> Volume level is useless until 40% level (can be audible only in ""Pin-drop silence ambience). Audible enough only post 40% level. Stereo speakers output are 70% bottom and 30 % earpiece. But full volume doesn't distort & is loud enough.> Haptics are tight but not strong, even in higher levels. Effective only post 40% and best only @ 90% level)> Hotspot drains battery quickly (even a warning notification pops up). Also, Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly. Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm).> Though the in-hand feel is good, the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit.> Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel.> The inbuild DAC (no 3.5 mm hole and only Type-C port) is not great. The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output. Perhaps, Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio output.

1,Harikrishnan,"For people who switch from budget phones this device is just a very different experience right from haptics to how much faster it performs although the drawback of the OS is slightly a let down after the merger of Oppo.The alert slider is what got me to this and the device is just too good for someone switching from redmi note 8 pro

4,Rama Rao,"I got this mobile (12Gb, 25Gb Ram variant)at 31k after 3k discount on icici credit card.For this price it's a must buy.I am using this product since last 2 weeks.The camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very well.The only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better, as a working professional it doesn't makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a day.If you have no issues with the battery section then just go for it.üëç

5,Dipak Suthar,"Writting this after user of 4 months, camera is really great in this Upper mid segment.Sound such a great like fall in love in just a couple of seconds music.Display is great even with 90hz you will not see any lag.Battery is quiet decent, 1 day with mid usage, 9-10 hrs with slight heavy usage and if you use with 5G you need to charge it twice a day because i am using it with Jio5G and its giving me 6-7hrs backup only with mid usage with continuous 5G data enabled.Charging Speed is great. Can give 100/100 point.Build Quality is superb.Finger-print is super fast.Mic and loud speaker is also great.
